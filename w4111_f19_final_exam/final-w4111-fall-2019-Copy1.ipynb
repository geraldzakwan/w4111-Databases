   "source": [
    "1. Structured data <br><br>\n",
    "Structured data is a data that strictly follows a predefined data model and has a high degree of organization. The model is tabular, containing columns (i.e. the data fields such as person name) and rows (i.e. the records or data sample). Since it has predefined fields, we can easily analyze the data, e.g. we can query by fields (or by a unique identifier called primary key), aggregate some fields or even combines fields from different table/relationship.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Example: Relational data stored in RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and other tabular data such as Excel files.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. Semi-structured data <br><br>\n",
    "Semi-structured data is a data that is not defined by the formal model associated with relational database (uses a fix set of columns, uses fix data type for each column, etc.). However, it contains tags to differentiate between elements with different meaning. Using tags, it can also build a hierarchies of records (object inside an object) or fields (e.g. a composite field) within the data.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Example: XML, JSON and YAML documents.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. Unstructured data <br><br>\n",
    "Unstructured data is a data that either doesn't have a predefined model (set of columns for example) or is not organized in a predefined manner (stored sequentially for example). Thus, it is hard to search through the data and to extract a specific information from the data as compared to the structured data.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Example: PDF documents, text messages (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.), social media photos, YouTube videos and document-based database such as MongoDB.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. Metadata <br><br>\n",
    "Metadata is a data about data. It describes another data (its type, structure, location, etc.) or provides some additional information regarding the data. Almost all kind of data is accompanied by a metadata, mostly for unstructured data (e.g. YouTube videos have a metadata describing the uploader, date uploaded, video category, etc.). Even structured data has metadata such as in the example below.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Example: MySQL stores a metadata that tells us about all the tables in a database schema and the property of each table (its columns, primary key, etc.). We can access this metadata via some commands like \"SHOW TABLES\" to list all the tables and \"DESC <table_name>\" to list columns in a table.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "5. BLOB <br><br>\n",
    "BLOB (Binary Large Object) is a data type in DBMS to store a large chunk of data in its binary form. It is usually used to store unstructured data that are not within the standard data types for DBMS (not integer, float, string, etc.) and takes much spaces. BLOB fields allocate space (up to several Giga Bytes) only whenever the content in the field is utilized.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Example: Let say we want to store social media photos and their caption in a database. Since images can't fit into any standard data type in DBMS and they use much spaces, we can use BLOB to store them. We can then store the caption simply as a string. So, we would have a table that looks like : (ID, BLOB_IMAGE, CAPTION).\n",

In a table, an attribute P is said to be functionally dependent on Q, if for every Q, the value of Q uniquely determines the value of P. For example, in a table of Columbia student, the field \"UNI\" should uniquely determine \"last_name\", \"first_name\" and \"major\". In other words, those three columns are functionally dependent to \"UNI\".\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. Data redundancy and update anomaly. <br><br>\n",
    "Data redundancy is a condition in a database system where the same piece of data is replicated, i.e. it is stored in two or more different places/records. When data is redundant, update anomaly can occur. The anomaly occurs when we incorrectly changes some existing information. Consider a table -> (bank_customer, branch, branch_address). If the branch_address for a certain branch changes, we need to update all the customer records which are associated the branch. Otherwise, the update anomaly occurs and there will be a data inconsistency. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. Decomposition <br><br>\n",
    "Decomposition is the process of breaking down a relation into smaller relations. The process should be lossless, i.e. it needs to make sure that the information in the original relation can be reconstructed based on the decomposed relations. Decomposition is often used to get rid of data redundancy. Consider the previous example. We can decompose the table by creating a new table that stores (branch, branch_address) and then create a foreign key from the original relation to the new table.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "5. BCNF <br><br>\n",
    "When a table has more than one candidate key, anomalies may result even though the relation is in 3NF. Boyce-Codd normal form is a special case of 3NF. A relation is in BCNF if, and only if, every determinant is a candidate key.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "5. First Normal Form and atomic domain <br><br>\n",
    "Atomic domain means that every value of in a field is an indivisible unit. A database is said to be in the first normal form (1NF) if it satisfies these two conditions: 1. It contains only atomic values 2. There are no repeating groups.\n",

    "The algorithm runs like an elevator. It does things as below:\n",
    "    - It scans down towards the nearest end\n",
    "    - When it hits the bottom, it scans up servicing the requests that it didn't get going down. \n",
    "    - If a request comes in after it has been scanned it will not be serviced until the process comes back down or moves back up.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. What is the _Clock Algorithm_ for page replace in a buffer pool. <br><br>\n",
    "In this algorithm, we arrange the buffer pool into a circular list, with each page in the buffer pool having an extra reference bit. The reference bit will be set to 1 when the pin count decreased to zero. When looking for replacement, it starts from the current clock hand position, looking for pages with zero pin count. There will be two conditions:\n",
    "    - If it is set, it means someone just unpinned it to zero, so it is recently used. The algorithm will clear reference bit, and go to the next unpinned page in the queue. This gives the page a “second chance” to survive.\n",
    "    - If it is not set, then it means we previously cleared it, so it has not been visited for a whole round. Select this page as a victim, replace it with newly loaded page.\n",

    "    - Choose the right scheduling technique. For example, if several blocks from a cylinder need to be transferred, we can optimize it by requesting them in the order in which they pass under the heads. One of the solutions it to use elevator algorithm.\n",
    "    - Design the right file organization. We can organize blocks on disk in a way that mimics how data is accessed. For example, to minimize seek time, we can store related data on the same track or on the adjacent tracks (or the adjacent cylinders if the data is big).\n",
    "    - Use log disk. It is devoted for writing a sequential log. Since all access to the log disk is sequential, the it eliminates seek time. Moreover, several consecutive blocks can be written at once, thus it is faster than random writes.\n",

    "4. Explain a possible combined use of table partitioning and disks with different read latency/performance. <br><br>\n",

    "5. What is columnar storage, what are some benefits and for which use cases does it help? <br><br>\n",
    "In a traditional relational (SQL) database, the data is stored by the row. For example, a student database (uni, first_name, age) will look like: (ab1234, alisson, 25); (vd1234, virgil, 27). Meanwhile, in columnar storage, it is arranged by column, so it will look like: (ab1234, vd1234); (alisson, virgil); (25, 27).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Some benefits from columnar storage or some use cases in which it performs better than traditional relational database:\n",
    "    - When we need to operate just on a few columns (let say 3 out of 50 columns in a table), the read process will be much lighter, especially in a database with huge number of rows (millions or above). This is because the columnar storage doesn't have to load the whole record fields.\n",
    "    - When we need to do aggregation, for example, to take the average of student's age, the query will be faster than that in relational database. The reason is the same as above (it doesn't have to load the whole record fields).\n",
    "    - Enable better data compression (as data in the same column have the same type).\n",

    "1. Give three advantages of a B+ Tree index relative to a hash index. <br>\n",
    "    - B+ Tree index is optimized for range query retrieval using inequality operator (e.g. searching for records ranging from key value A to key value B). Hash index on the other hand will suffer because we can't sort based on the hashed value. Hash index only supports equality operator.\n",
    "    - B+ Tree index can speed up ORDER BY operations, meanwhile hash index is not able to do that with the same reason as above.\n",
    "    - With a B+ Tree index, we can search by any leftmost prefix of the key, useful when dealing with string based key. Meanwhile, hash index can only search based on the whole key.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. What is a covering index? Why use it? <br><br>\n",
    "A covering index is a non-clustered index which includes all columns that are referred in a query (all columns in the SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc.). Covering index is useful when we frequently query based on some non-key columns that are not indexed. When using covering index, we avoid a further lookup to retrieve any non-key data. Normally, without covering index, we still have to scan sequentially to match the non-key columns after using the non-clustered index. With covering index, we avoid that further lookup as all columns are in the non-clustered index.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. What issue does a write intensive workload cause for B+ Tree indexes? <br><br>\n",
    "Too many insertions and deletions will cause a considerable amount of overhead for B+ Tree Indexes. This is because it maintains pointers not only from parent to child but also sequential pointers in the last level (leaf nodes). Most of the time, an insertion or deletion would cause a rearrangement of the nodes and sometimes extra space. This becomes worse when we insert a record with the same key (if alllowed) or when we delete a node such that some nodes must be heavily rearranged, i.e. some nonleaf nodes are moved bottom up.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. VERY briefly describe an LSM Tree. <br><br>\n",
    "LSM Tree (\"Log Structured Merge Tree\") is a way to store data with robustness against high insert and update rates. It consists of two or more levels, just like any other tree. The simplest versions consist of two levels: C0 and C1. C0 is small and stored entirely in memory, whereas C1 is huge and stored on disk. Records are inserted (or updated) in C0 (often called memtable, implemented using, for example, an AVL Tree). If the insertion is performed when C0 is full, a contiguous segment of entries is removed from C0 and merged into C1 on disk. C1 comprises of many immutable log segments accompanied by index, e.g. hash index, for quick lookup. C1 is generally implemented using SSTables (string sorted table).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "5. VERY briefly explain index key compression, how it works, its benefits and when it is applicable. <br><br>\n",
    "Index key compression reduces the size of index file by compressing repeating key values. It splits the index key into two parts: \n",
    "    - The prefix column (which are potentially shared across multiple key values); \n",
    "    - The suffix column (which is unique to every index key). The same prefix columns will be stored once. <br><br>\n",
    "Some benefits beside storage efficiency: \n",
    "    - Better cache efficiency when loading index to memory\n",
    "    - Fewer leaf blocks and shallow tree (if using tree based index)\n",
    "    - Fewer logical IOs as size is smaller <br><br>\n",
    "Index key compression is applicable (or makes sense) when:\n",
    "    - The index has repeated leading values\n",
    "    - The index is a composite index of 2 or more columns\n",
    "    - Compression defined for a maximum of n-1 columns  (where n is the number of columns in the index).  That is, the last column cannot be compressed.\n",

    "Materialization is one strategy in query processing. This strategy evaluates one operation at a time, starting at the lowest level. It uses intermediate results stored in temporary relations to execute the operations in the higher level. This strategy can be optimized by using a materialized view, a view that is actually stored (think of it as a copy of table records). Thus, DBMS doesn't have to recompute some operations and it instead just loads the stored materialized view. This is like caching the results of a query. Materialized view is useful when we have a subquery that is frequently used. We can just store the result of that subquery as a materialized view.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Pipelining is another strategy to execute a query. Pipelining evaluates several operations simultaneously and pass the result (tuple-wise or block-wise) on to the next operation without waiting for the current operation to finish. For example, once a tuple satisfies a SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE operation, it is directly passed on to the next operation, e.g. a JOIN. Pipelining is much cheaper than materialization, because temporary relations are not generated and stored on disk. But it is not always possible, e.g. if sorting is needed.\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. Explain optimistic concurrent control, and the pros and cons. <br><br>\n",
    "Optimistic concurrency control assumes that conflict is rare. Thus, it allows concurrent transactions to proceed without delays to ensure serializability. Instead of using locks, it optimistically does transaction and then check at the end if it can commit the results (retry if not). <br>\n",
    "The pros:\n",
    "    - Transactions are executed more efficiently.\n",
    "    - Data content is relatively safe.\n",
    "    - Throughput is much higher.<br>\n",

    "3. Consider the following two transactions.<br><br>\n",
    "    - T1: R1(A), W1(A), R1(B), W1(B)\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "Answer:<br>\n",
    "    - In general, to make the schedule serial, we can move all T1 transactions so that they happen before T2. It can be done by swapping non-conflicting operations (operations involving different data) in two steps below. <br><br>\n",
    "    - First, we can swap two non-conflicting operations R2(A) and R1(B) in S1. This result in a new schedule:<br>\n",
    "    S2: R1(A), W1(A), R1(B), W2(A), R2(A), W1(B), R2(B), W2(B) <br><br>\n",

    "    S3: R1(A), W1(A), R1(B), W1(B), R2(A), W2(A), R2(B), W2(B) <br><br>\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. Explain _cascading abort._ What locking technique prevents the problem? <br><br>\n",
    "Cascading abort/rollback is a condition where the abort of a transaction forces the abort of other transactions that are dependent to the aborted transaction. This is to prevent those other transactions from reading an uncommitted data. Cascading abort is a heavy operation and most of the time it is best to avoid it.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Locking techniques that may prevent cascading abort is those that restrict transactions to only read committed data, such as the strict two phase locking (2PL). Since strict 2PL always results in cascadeless schedules, then cascading abort won't occur. This protocol simplifies transaction aborts (compared to conservative 2PL).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "5. Explain the concepts of the concepts of the transaction processing acronyms _ACID_ and _BASE._ <br><br>\n",
    "ACID is a set of property which is followed by traditional relational databases such as MySQL. ACID consists of these properties:\n",
    "    - Atomicity: Either all operations in a transaction are performed or none are. Partial executions are not allowed.\n",
    "    - Consistency: The transaction should leave the database in a consistent state (from a valid state to another valid state).\n",
    "    - Isolation: The transaction should be executed independently of other transactions.\n",
    "    - Durability: When a transaction has committed, its effects should persist despite any subsequent system crashes. It is usually reflected in nonvolatile storage. Transaction failures cannot leave the data in a partially committed state.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Whereas ACID enforces reliable transaction processing in MySQL, BASE enables flexibility and scalability in NoSQL. BASE consists of these properties:\n",
    "    - Basically Available: The system is guaranteed to always be available for all users. Note that there is no isolation here and inconsistent result may occur.\n",
    "    - Soft State: The values stored in the system may change over time even when there is no input. This is due to the eventual consistency property that is explained below.\n",
    "    - Eventually Consistent: This indicates that the system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that time. As data is added to the system, the system’s state is gradually replicated across all nodes and might result in a temporary inconsistency.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "From CAP theorem point of view, ACID gives up availability, meanwhile BASE gives up consistency.\n",

    "1. Why is querying  ```lahman2019clean.annual_performance_summary_copy``` so much faster than querying ```lahman2019clean.annual_summary?``` <br><br>\n",
    "```annual_performance_summary_copy``` is a copy table meanwhile ```lahman2019clean.annual_summary``` is a view. When querying from a copy table, we operate directly on the records that are already stored within the copy table. Meanwhile, when querying on a view, we instead need to execute all the operations needed to create the view from the actual table, starting from the ```batting_summary``` to the ```annual_summary```. View is a virtual table afterall, thus there is no record stored in it. Thus, querying the ```annual_performance_summary_copy``` is much faster than querying ```annual_summary``` as we don't have to requery the records.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. If views are so much slower than copy tables, give the primary reason why a database design might choose a view? <br><br>\n",
    "Copy tables are not associated with the base table, i.e. changes in the base table won't be reflected on the copy table (unless we define a way to do so). Thus, when we query on the copy table, we might get an outdated data. Meanwhile, when we use a view, we will always query based on the current condition of the base table. Hence, if the base table is write intensive (thus it is an overhead to reflect changes from the base table to the copy table) and the view operations are light (doesn't involve multiple joins), then view is more desirable over copy table.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. What are three general reasons/general benefits of using views compared to just executing the SQL on underlying tables. <br><br>\n",
    "    - View provides an abstraction to simplify the query. View can draw data from several tables and present a single aggregated table. Thus, it simplifies the information, hides the complexity and turns multi-table queries into single-table queries.\n",
    "    - View enforces logical data independence and consistency. A view can present a consistent structure of the database, even if the underlying tables are split, restructured, or renamed. Thus, changes in underlying table don't affect its user (or an application program that uses it).\n",
    "    - View can act as a security mechanism, i.e. restrict what columns and/or records can be accessed by a certain group of users. This allows surfacing only the data that a user needs to see.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. Explain, in two or three sentences, how you handle reflecting changes in the base tables in the data in the copy table. <br><br>\n",
    "I would create a TRIGGER that acts upon UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE on the underlying table (batting, pitching, fielding, appearances). The trigger will execute these steps/commands:\n",
    "    - For UPDATE operation only, check if the updated columns are used in any of the view (batting_summary, pitching_summary, fielding_summary, appearances_summary, annual_summary). If there isn't any view using them, no further action is needed. Otherwise (or if the operation is INSERT or DELETE), proceed to the next steps below.\n",
    "    - Drop the copy table, i.e. execute ```DROP TABLE lahman2019clean.annual_performance_summary_copy```\n",
    "    - Finally, recreate the copy table using ```CREATE TABLE lahman2019clean.annual_performance_summary_copy AS SELECT * from annual_summary;```\n",
